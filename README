Cudacoin is a Kepler-and-later optimized implementation
of scrypt-based coin mining (Litecoin, etc.) for Nvidia
GPUs.  It _requires_ kepler (compute_30) or later
and will not compile for older architectures.

As a proof of concept, building this code will produce
two binaries that can be run:
  - hasher_bench
  - hasher_test

By default, hasher_bench will scan 200,000 keys and show
the time and Kh/s rate achieved in doing so.

hasher_test tests that scanning and several of the
individual components of the system work properly.

In addition, it will build key_per_thread, which is a 
naive mining implementation that I wrote for comparison.
It is not particularly useful.

This is not a standalone miner:  The main result of
compiling it is a shared object (.so) file, hasher_c.so,
which must then be linked into cpuminer with a modified 
implementation of cpuminer/scrypt.c.  (file "scrypt.c")

TODO:  Pull in cpuminer or write a better one.  I lean towards
the latter:  cpuminer's structure is very geared towards
efficiently using the CPUs for mining, with a lot of very
unnecessary complexity when it's simply farming out to GPUs.
It's possible that cgminer might be a better starting point.

Before compiling:
  Ensure that "nvcc" is in your $PATH.

To compile:
  make
  cp scrypt.c hasher_c.o hasher_c.h hasher.o ../cpuminer/
  cd ../cpuminer/
  make
    * look for the error message about not finding scanhash_c
    * copy/paste that gcc line and add hasher_c.so at the end

Yes.  This is really lame, and what you get from a proof-of-concept
piece of code instead of something designed to be easy to use.  Sorry.
